- The tables are already normalized up to 3NF
- The cells in each table contains only single atomic values and each row is unique, hence it is 1NF normalized
- There are no composite Primary keys, no partial dependencies. Hence all tables are 2NF normalized
- All None key columns in all tables depend on the primary key in the table. Hence all the tables are 3NF normalized
